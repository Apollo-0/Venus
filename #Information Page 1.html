<H3> About Us! </H3>
<p> Our buissnes was originally set up in 2804 and we have 
    been thriving ever since! We are part of a long chain of 
    buissneses including: LUCID (the clothing brand)
    and ThunderStorm venues.
    We always try to put our customers first and listen to any
    feedback given to improve yours, and others, experience
    with us. </p>

<H3> More about our company! </H3>
<p> As you have read we are one paart of a larger corportion,
    that being: LiberosisCorps. Started in 2754, 50 years before
    our cafes were created, an idea to create a wide spread 
    buissness was founded; creatin a surplus amount of job
    opportunities in richer and poorer areas.

    Founded by Lucid Liberosis, also known a LL, the company 
    has been passed on throuh three generations until its 
    reached todays founder: Apollo Liberosis. The company is still
    growing and there are more plans and opertunities in
    future, but for now we will have to see what will happen. </p>
